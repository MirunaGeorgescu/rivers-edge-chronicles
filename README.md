# River's Edge Chronicles ‚ú®
River's Edge Chronicles is a captivating 3D game developed during the Game Development Using Unreal Engine 5 class in my 3rd year of studying Computer Science at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. The game unfolds in a picturesque medieval village, surrounded by a mysterious river, with an imposing castle at its center. Your goal is to explore this intricate map, interacting with various elements and characters.
